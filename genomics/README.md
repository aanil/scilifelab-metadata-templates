# SciLifeLab Genomics Technical Metadata Template

The _SciLifeLab Genomics Technical Metadata Template_ is a data-type specific template, collecting __technical metadata for genomics data produced at the Genomics platform__. As such, it fulfills submission requirements from the main recipient repository _ENA_ ([European Nucleotide Archive](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/)). 

In addition, the template includes SciLifeLab specific [organisational metadata fields](https://github.com/ScilifelabDataCentre/scilifelab-metadata-templates/blob/main/organisational_metadata_fields.yml) relevant for data provenance for the researcher as well as other metadata consumers at SciLifeLab. These can be omitted when submitting to public end repositories, such as ENA.

## Contact
For __general questions__ about the _SciLifeLab Genomics Technical Metadata Template_, please contact data-management@scilifelab.se. 

For __specific questions regarding filled-in metadata files received as part of a data delivery from NGI__ as the data-producing unit, please contact support@ngisweden.se. 

## Formats 
The genomics template can be downloaded in the following __formats__:

- A [_genomics_technical_metadata.json_](https://github.com/ScilifelabDataCentre/scilifelab-metadata-templates/blob/main/genomics/genomics_technical_metadata.json) listing all required metadata fields with their attribute descriptors and controlled vocabularies fetched from ENA where applicable, for reference. 
- A [ _genomics_technical_metadata.tsv_](https://github.com/ScilifelabDataCentre/scilifelab-metadata-templates/blob/main/genomics/genomics_technical_metadata.tsv) containing only the field names as a header row, to be filled in with the information for individual runs (1 (single or paired) run per row). 
- A [_genomics_template_schema.json_](https://github.com/ScilifelabDataCentre/scilifelab-metadata-templates/blob/main/genomics/genomics_template_schema.json) __schema__ against which a filled-in _.tsv_ can be validated to ensure that it complies with the template. 

## Example files
In addition, there are two __example__ files available that show how a filled-in _.tsv_ could look:
- [example_data/example-genomics_technical_metadata_bam.tsv](https://github.com/ScilifelabDataCentre/scilifelab-metadata-templates/blob/main/genomics/example_data/example-genomics_technical_metadata_bam.tsv): an example for a HiFi data experiment with a single .bam file.
- [example_data/example-genomics_technical_metadata_fastq.tsv](https://github.com/ScilifelabDataCentre/scilifelab-metadata-templates/blob/main/genomics/example_data/example-genomics_technical_metadata_fastq.tsv): an example for HiC and RNAseq data experiments with paired fastq files. 

## Validation
Last but not least, there exists a __validation__ script that can be used to validate a filled-in _.tsv_ against the template schema, [scripts/validate_json_schema.py](https://github.com/ScilifelabDataCentre/scilifelab-metadata-templates/blob/main/genomics/scripts/validate_json_schema.py). It can be passed a multi-row tsv to validate against the template schema as follows
```
python validate_json_schema.py path/to/your/tsv/file.tsv
```
Optionally, the schema can be specified using `python validate_json_schema.py path/to/your.tsv --schema path/to/schema.json` with the default being set as `../genomics_template_schema.json`. 

## Regarding data submissions to public end repositories

The main recipient repositories for genomic data are [European Nucleotide Archive](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/) (ENA) and [ArrayExpress](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/arrayexpress). Note that the nucleotide sequencing data submitted to ArrayExpress is forwarded (by them via brokering) to ENA. The SciLifeLab Genomics Technical Metadata Template is designed to be compatible with the metadata requirements for data submissions to ENA. 

For an interactive submission of the technical metadata via its Webin Submissions Portal, ENA requires a single _.tsv_ file containing the technical fields listed as parts of the template below (curated from ENA.experiment and ENA.run object metadata). 

Specific notes on the collected metadata fields: 
- ENA submissions distinguish between submission of single read and paired reads. Some fields are only relevant if handling paired reads data stored as a pair of fastq files (`insert_size`, `reverse_file_name`, `reverse_file_md5`). In this case the file name path stored in `file_name` and the MD5 checksum stored in `file_md5` correspond to the ENA fields `forward_file_name` and `forward_file_md5`. 
    - The value of the field `library_layout` is set to distinguish between the `SINGLE` and `PAIRED` reads cases.
- The field `library_name` is populated by the data producing unit with the same value as the `experimental_sample_id` field and is required to be unique per file (pair). 
- The ENA fields `design_description`(not listed below) and `library_construction_protocol` cover largely the same information and are seen as redundant of each other. We decide to populate (only) `library_construction_protocol` for the SciLifeLab genomics template. 
- We programmatically fetch the controlled vocabularies accepted by ENA for the following fields
    - `instrument_model`
    - `library_source`
    - `library_selection`
    - `library_strategy`
    - `library_layout`
    - `file_type`
